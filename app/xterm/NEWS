                            Patch #399 - 2025/05/18

     * add configure check for inline, for c89 support.
     * further  improve  integration  between  UTF-8  and allowC1Printable
       (report by Matthieu Herrb).
     * modify  one  of  the missing-character checks to prefer Xft's check
       over   the   check  for  missing  line-drawing  characters  (Debian
       #1084794).
     * align  terminfo building blocks in terminfo to correspond to recent
       refactoring/trimming in ncurses.
     * revise a limit-check in selection to fix a regression in patch #398
       (Debian #1105738).
     * modify  configure  check  for  Xft  to work around recent change to
       fontconfig's pkg-config file (Gentoo #953864).
